Many years ago, there lived a chubby koala. His name was Karl. Karl was famous for being the only koala in all of Australia to dislike eucalyptus leaves. He much preferred spaghetti.

Each day, Karl would wake up, make himself a bowl of spaghetti, and then take a nap. He did this with lunch and dinner as well. After several years, Karl became the pudgiest Koala in his neighborhood. And he was happy.

This was the first time in a long time that the Koalas had a meal together.

One day, Karl realized it was a little harder to get up the tree than usual. He thought to himself, “hmmm, if I played more games with my friends every day, I might be quicker up the tree.”
